                            From my grandfather Verus1 I learned good morals and the government ofmy temper.From the reputation and remembrance of my father,2 modesty and amanly character.From my mother,3 piety and beneficence, and abstinence, not only fromevil deeds, but even from evil thoughts; and further, simplicity in my wayof living, far removed from the habits of the rich.From my great-grandfather,4 not to have frequented public schools, andto have had good teachers at home, and to know that on such things a manshould spend liberally.From my governor, to be neither of the green nor of the blue party at thegames in the Circus, nor a partisan either of the Parmularius or theScutarius at the gladiators’ fights; from him too I learned endurance oflabour, and to want little, and to work with my own hands, and not tomeddle with other people’s affairs, and not to be ready to listen to slander.From Diognetus,5 not to busy myself about trifling things, and not to givecredit to what was said by miracle-workers and jugglers about incantationsand the driving away of daemons and such things; and not to breed quailsfor fighting, nor to give myself up passionately to such things; and toendure freedom of speech; and to have become intimate with philosophy;and to have been a hearer, first of Bacchius, then of Tandasis andMarcianus; and to have written dialogues in my youth; and to have desireda plank bed and skin, and whatever else of the kind belongs to the Greciandiscipline.From Rusticus6 I received the impression that my character requiredimprovement and discipline; and from him I learned not to be led astray tosophistic emulation, nor to writing on speculative matters, nor to deliveringlittle hortatory orations, nor to showing myself off as a man who practises
much discipline, or does benevolent acts in order to make a display; and toabstain from rhetoric, and poetry, and fine writing; and not to walk about inthe house in my outdoor dress, nor to do other things of the kind; and towrite my letters with simplicity, like the letter which Rusticus wrote fromSinuessa to my mother; and with respect to those who have offended me bywords, or done me wrong, to be easily disposed to be pacified andreconciled, as soon as they have shown a readiness to be reconciled; and toread carefully, and not to be satisfied with a superficial understanding of abook; nor hastily to give my assent to those who talk overmuch; and I amindebted to him for being acquainted with the discourses of Epictetus,which he communicated to me out of his own collection.From Apollonius7 I learned freedom of will and undeviating steadiness ofpurpose; and to look to nothing else, not even for a moment, except toreason; and to be always the same, in sharp pains, on the occasion of theloss of a child, and in long illness; and to see clearly in a living examplethat the same man can be both most resolute and yielding, and not peevishin giving his instruction; and to have had before my eyes a man who clearlyconsidered his experience and his skill in expounding philosophicalprinciples as the smallest of his merits; and from him I learned how toreceive from friends what are esteemed favours, without being eitherhumbled by them or letting them pass unnoticed.From Sextus,8 a benevolent disposition, and the example of a familygoverned in a fatherly manner, and the idea of living conformably to nature;and gravity without affectation, and to look carefully after the interests offriends, and to tolerate ignorant persons, and those who form opinionswithout consideration: he had the power of readily accommodating himselfto all, so that intercourse with him was more agreeable than any flattery;and at the same time he was most highly venerated by those who associatedwith him: and he had the faculty both of discovering and ordering, in anintelligent and methodical way, the principles necessary for life; and henever showed anger or any other passion, but was entirely free frompassion, and also most affectionate; and he could express approbationwithout noisy display, and he possessed much knowledge withoutostentation.From Alexander9 the grammarian, to refrain from faultfinding, and not ina reproachful way to chide those who uttered any barbarous or solecistic orstrange-sounding expression; but dexterously to...
